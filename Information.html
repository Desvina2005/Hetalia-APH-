It later continued as a full series that same year, and in 2008 began being adapted into printed manga tankōbon. In September 2011 the series began being serialized monthly in Comic Birz magazine, which ended in June 2013. In September 2014, the series relaunched in Shonen Jump Plus under the new title of Hetalia: World☆Stars (ヘタリア World☆Stars?). The series has also been adapted into several drama CDs, video games, and anime series. </p>

          <p>The series involves anthropomorphic representations of the world's nations, with the main storyline taking place in WWI and WWII, though the majority of the series is comprised of a series of one shot stories set in earlier and more modern eras. The series is named for the main character Italy, with "Hetalia" being a portmanteau of the words hetare (useless) and Italia.<br><br>In 2010, the published manga was licensed by Tokyopop in North America and the first two volumes were published in English. Two months before the third volume was scheduled to be released, the company ceased US publishing operations. Remnants of the company later formed a partnership with Right Stuf to publish the series on demand, and the third volume was published in 2012. The following three volumes have also since been published in English through Right Stuf.</p>

          <p class="text-white">During WWI, Germany, in search of the heir to the empire of Ancient Rome, finds Italy hiding in a crate and takes him as a captive. After living with him to the start of WWII, Italy takes it upon himself to become Germany's ally. The two are soon joined by Japan, though the three wind up having to deal with the arrival of the Allied Forces: America, England, France, China, and Russia.</p>

          <p class="text-white">The Hetalia series is notable for its large, colorful cast of characters. Each of the characters represents a nation, complete with the stereotypes attributed to it. The original webcomic initially focused on the nations of the Axis Powers vs. the Allied Forces, with the cast quickly expanding to include others.&nbsp;<br><br>Most of the earlier cast members have a "human name" in addition to their nation name, though they were never used in the actual series or profiles. They were first given to the characters by Himaruya when a fan requested alternate names to refer to the characters by, out of curisosity as to what their "normal" names would be. It is rumored that this question was asked due to Japanese fans' worries of controversy over pairing the characters with their nation names, but the true motive remains a source of debate.&nbsp;<br><br>Despite never being used in canon (aside from select characters' names getting brief mentions in the April Fools' 2008 summary and America's name "Alfred" being mentioned in a throwaway line in one strip), the alternate human names stuck with the characters until early 2008, when Himaruya deleted his old update logs from the previous year. Characters created after 2007, later in that year, or that were not mentioned in the original name listing, do not have any sort of official human name to refer to them by and are only known by their nation names. It remains to be seen if Himaruya will ever do an updated version of the name list, although he seems open to the idea of suggestions and letting fans name certain characters as they please.&nbsp;<br><br>Himaruya also gave most of the characters "human ages", as a fan asked how old the characters were supposed to look, but this detail was mostly dropped as well. However, some later-personified nations (such as Iceland) do have an age listed for them in their character designs.</p>

          <p class="text-white">Original Web Version<br><br>The Main Storyline for the webcomic was published in 2006. It is comprised of five chapters and two side stories (Japan Omake Comic and Chibitalia), though the fifth chapter remains incomplete. An additional two chapters and side story (Shotalia) were planned but never realized, as the format of the series changed. Portions of the fifth chapter and the Chibitalia storyline were later reprinted in the first volume of the published manga, while content from other chapters were rewritten in the same volume.<br><br>Originally designed as a miniseries, the main chapters and the first side story focus on the end of World War I and the build-up to World War II, with the fifth chapter showing the mobilization for the 1939 invasion of Poland. While aspects of the second World War would later inspire some stand-alone comics, this storyline has yet to be directly revisited. The side-story Chibitalia focuses on a young Italy as he is falls under the control of Austria as a result of the Italian Wars.&nbsp;<br><br>The original format of the series was revised to encompass a series of unconnected stories which touched on various characters and time periods, as well as cultural differences and obscure historical trivia. A handful of early short strips were collected into groupings referred to as the Comic Diaries, while others were grouped into short series or comprised event comics commemorating holidays such as April Fools' Day and Christmas. Several of these stories have been reprinted or rewritten in the published manga.&nbsp;<br><br>A handful of comics no longer exist on the main Kitayume website nor on Bamboo Thicket, whether they have been outright deleted or the files and pages have been hidden. On at least one occasion, a discarded strip was rewritten years later, while others that were previously removed have been relisted on the website.</p>

The first four volumes consisted primarily of republished or redrawn versions of comics from the original webcomic alongside new material. The final two volumes were largely comprised of comics serialized in Comic Birz. All volumes except for the first received a limited edition release, the second through fifth packaged with a bonus booklet and the sixth with a drama CD. This version marked the change in ordering for the title of the series, using Hetalia: Axis Powers instead of Axis Powers Hetalia.</p>
